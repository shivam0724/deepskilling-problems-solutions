### 1. Understand Asymptotic Notation

#### 1.1 Explain Big O Notation and How It Helps in Analyzing Algorithms

Big O notation is a mathematical representation used to describe the **upper bound** of an algorithm's time complexity or space complexity in relation to the size of the input data. It provides a high-level understanding of how the performance of an algorithm scales as the input size increases.

#### 1.2 Describe the Best, Average, and Worst-Case Scenarios for Search Operations

**Best-Case Scenario**  
Definition: The desired element is found in the first position.  
Time Complexity: **O(1)** â€” constant time.

**Average-Case Scenario**  
Definition: The desired element is randomly located.  
- Linear Search: **O(n)**  
- Binary Search (sorted data only): **O(log n)**

**Worst-Case Scenario**  
Definition: The desired element is at the end or not present.  
- Linear Search: **O(n)**  
- Binary Search: **O(log n)**

### 2. Analysis

#### 2.1 Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.

**Linear Search**
- Time Complexity: **O(n)**
- Best Case: O(1) (element found at the first position)
- Average Case: O(n) (element found in the middle)
- Worst Case: O(n) (element not found or at the end)

**Binary Search**
- Time Complexity: **O(log n)**
- Best Case: O(1) (element found at the middle)
- Average Case: O(log n) (element found in the middle of the search space)
- Worst Case: O(log n) (element not found or at the end of the search space)

#### 2.2 Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.

**Binary Search** is more suitable for platforms where the data is sorted and the search operation needs to be efficient. It significantly reduces the number of comparisons needed to find an element compared to linear search, especially as the size of the dataset increases.
